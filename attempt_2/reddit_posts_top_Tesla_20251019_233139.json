        "selftext": "**Tesla’s futuristic Cybertruck is flopping hard, pushing Elon Musk to offload unsold trucks to his own ventures like SpaceX and xAI to hide the mounting inventory.**\n\n\n\nThe Cybertruck nightmare is well and truly here. Just months after Elon Musk’s bold promises of annual sales reaching a quarter million, Tesla’s stainless-steel-clad pickup is nose-diving. Latest data shows Tesla sold only about 5,385 Cybertrucks in Q3 2025 a crushing 63% drop from last year. For the full year, sales are on track to barely hit 20,000 units, a far cry from Musk’s early hype.\n\n\n\nThe situation is so grim that Musk has resorted to a desperate and eyebrow-raising move: selling unsold Cybertrucks to his own companies. Deliveries of Cybertrucks have been spotted to SpaceX and xAI, Musk’s AI startup, padding Tesla’s own sales numbers. Whether these internal transfers are counted in official numbers or just a accounting band-aid remains unclear.\n\n\n\nThe Cybertruck’s troubles don’t end with disappointing sales. Its pricing, once advertised at under $40,000, now often starts near $80,000. Recalls, design criticism, and scepticism about real-world driving range have only added to consumer wariness. The truck’s polarising angular looks and political controversies surrounding Musk haven’t helped either.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s competitors, like Ford with its F-150 Lightning, are grabbing EV pickup market share. The Cybertruck’s slump mirrors broader struggles in Tesla’s lineup, which saw overall sales slow despite surging demand for Model 3 and Y.\n\n\n\nFor Musk, the Cybertruck’s flop is no minor hiccup it’s a glaring miss on a project once hailed as revolutionary. Selling trucks to himself may hide the inventory for now, but the uphill battle to reclaim public trust and market momentum is only just beginning.",

        "selftext": "The United States is built on two workforces. Cheap immigrant labor and highly technical educated labor.\n\nCheap immigrant labor is used in every facet of labor intensive industries. All resource extraction, construction, agriculture, manufacturing, food processing, shipping, etc uses it extensively. These immigrants are being targeted for removal by the Trump administration. Without these bodies to do the work these sectors will not be able to function. Removing this cheap labor also increases the price floor of labor for these industries and all others as well. So even if the industries can fill the vacancies the price for labor will drastically reduce or even eliminate their profit margin and the impacts all industries.\n\nHighly technical educated labor produces advanced tech goods and services. Amazon, Facebook, tesla, spacex, Nvidia, Microsoft, Boeing, lockeed Martin, Raytheon, etc all depend heavily on an educated labor force. This labor force is educated in liberal education systems. By this I mean a system that at least attempts to teach critical thinking. This is not a trait that is taught under fascism. Educated labor force is also acquired by importing educated immigrants who will not be coming or let in to the US in the current numbers under facism. By eliminating the educated labor pool tech industries will not be able to function.\n\nThe US is also a consumption based economy. Increasing the cost of goods consumed in the US by either reducing the labor force and increasing its cost through deportation reduces how much can be consumed. Increasing the cost by imposing tarrifs also reduces consumption. The reduced consumptions reduces profits.\n\nMuch of the entertainment industry is very liberal either by the people producing it or the content of the media and by what the consumers want. Disney and others would have severely curtailed profits under facism.\n\nBlue states/cities subsidies red states/counties to an alarming degree. I have never personally had to do precise technical work while being threatened be I doubt I would be very effective in my work. Sending in military and paramilitary personal into blue areas under facism is threatening every worker of every industry in those areas. Productivity will decrease leading to financial hardships for companies.\n\nI honestly don't really care about company bottom lines as much as not living in a facist dictatorship but I really don't understand why companies are supporting this when, imo, a great many won't survive or will be greatly curtailed finacially.",

        "selftext": "**Once billed as a revolution in pickup design, the Tesla Cybertruck is now tanking in sales down more than 60 percent year over year, even as the broader EV market surges.**\n\n\n\nWho could have seen this coming? Tesla’s stainless-steel wonder truck has slammed into a wall of consumer reality. In the third quarter of 2025, Tesla sold just over 5,400 Cybertrucks, marking a staggering 62.6 percent drop from the same period last year. That’s according to data from Cox Automotive, which confirms Tesla’s so-called futuristic pickup is now one of the company’s slowest sellers.\n\n\n\nThe number is even more embarrassing given that the rest of the EV market is thriving. The third quarter was a record-setter for electric car sales across the industry, as buyers scrambled to take advantage of the federal EV tax credit before it expired in late September. With companies like Ford, Rivian, and even Chevrolet speeding ahead, Tesla’s once-dominant position now looks shaky and the Cybertruck is the weak link dragging it down.\n\n\n\nIt’s not hard to see why. The vehicle’s polarizing design, sky-high prices, and production headaches have all eroded interest. Early hype promised a $39,990 entry price, but the cheapest version now starts around eighty thousand dollars. Add in uneven quality, bizarre design proportions, and Elon Musk’s increasingly chaotic public image, and you have a perfect storm of falling demand.\n\n\n\nMusk once claimed Tesla could build and sell a quarter million Cybertrucks per year. Nearly two years on, cumulative global sales barely top sixteen thousand. Meanwhile, Ford has moved roughly twice as many F-150 Lightnings during the same period, proving that conventional design and practicality still win over stainless style and sci-fi swagger.\n\n\n\nThe Cybertruck’s downfall is a reality check. For all the talk of unbreakable glass, bulletproof panels, and Mars-ready versatility, the market has spoken. Consumers may love futuristic ideas, but when the future finally arrives looking like a steel wedge priced like a small house, they’ll take a hard pass.",

Against my better judgement, my husband and I went into one of these cars (a red Tesla) at a rate agreed upon by the Storehouse personel. Once we got in the car, the driver sped off and said a different, much higher rate. We told him to let us out of the car, as we had agreed on a lower rate. He declined and sped up as he LOCKED US in the car. He stopped the car and demanded cash, saying racist things to my husband. We were still in the navy yard compound this point.  I started screaming out the window and trying to get attention from a far away security guard. My husband had to physically threaten driver in order to let us out of the car, at which point the driver finally opened the doors and let us out.\n\nAll this to say, DO NOT get in unmarked cars at this venue even if the venue personnel advises you that it’s a taxi, and if you can, bring pepper spray or something to defend yourself. I don’t want to think about what the driver would have done to me (27F) if I was alone. I’m reporting the incident to the venue as well.",

Instead, it has relied on word of mouth marketing, social media posts, and press coverage of the company’s ambitious promises in order to stay forefront in the public eye. Musk has stated that he “hates advertising” and that running ads is the equivalent of lying (even as he runs ads with lies in them).\n\nBut that’s changing. Tesla hired then quickly fired an ad team, but continues to do social media marketing largely on Twitter, the platform that Musk overpaid billions of dollars for and then turned into a white supremacist haven, causing advertisers to flee (who Musk told to leave and then sued to try to force them back).\n\nAfter chasing away advertisers, Musk resorted to a common tactic of his – channeling money from one of his public companies into one of his private companies, in the form of paid Tesla advertisements.\n\nMost recently, those advertisements have been focused not on marketing Tesla’s products to twitter users, but rather on marketing Musk’s stock award.\n\nIn fact, Tesla even recently broke the last bastion of its reluctance towards certain marketing efforts, and started running paid TV ads, but it wasn’t to market the company’s products, rather just to market Musk’s $1 trillion pay package.",

        "selftext": "Before I get started I want to say that Tesla is not in the mag 7 anymore. In case you missed it, Broadcom $AVGO is worth roughly 30% more than the electric car company/robotics/etaxi/robotics company.  For the purpose of this discussion, I think it’s important to preface it with the Oct 2025 magnificent 7 you all know and love, but clarify that Tesla is no longer a part of it, and Broadcom is. Apple is miles better than Tesla anyways from a fundamental standpoint. \n\nI also want to say that I think Apple is a great company.  I don’t think Apple is a bad investment by any means, but I am prepared to claim that it will have the worst returns of the magnificent 7 in the next decade.  Did you know that Apple has only grown their top line revenue by 10% since 2021?? (Yahoo finance). \n\nTheir moat is still fine. As long as everyone has those blue text messages, I don’t think I’ll ever want to go with a different phone.  But their moat is not actively growing.  I think when compared to other companies at this echelon, Apple has the smallest runway for this reason.  The core product offerings are fine, and here is a list of their products by revenue for FY 2024.\n\niPad: $26.69 B\niPhone: $201.18 B\nMac: $29.98 B\nService: $96.17 B\nWearables, Home and Accessories: $37.01 B\n\n(2024-2025) https://bullfincher.io/companies/apple/revenue-by-segment\n\nDoing some quick maths, a little over 50% of revenue comes from the iPhone.  That’s more diversified than I initially expected, but still somewhat dependent on iPhone (and let’s be honest, 60% of the ‘services’ number is likely coming from iPhone anyways, with maybe some also coming from Apple TV).  iPhone is far and away the reason Apple is so successful.  Their other products are lackluster IMO and I think their revenue numbers back up this claim.  It’s anecdotal to say this, but iPhone is great and everything else they have is unnecessary.  \n\nIn the context of the AI frenzy/bubble, Apple has not done much, and seemingly have bet that they don’t need to.  I’m sure they have something up their sleeves in regards to this, but am not convinced it will significantly enhance their core product offerings. \n\nTLDR Apple is a good company, but I I think there are greener pastures in other places. - sent from my iPhone \n\nEdit 1 - in defense on Amazon, at least compared to Apple - at least Amazon is growing their revenues close to 10% a year vs 10% over the last 4 years.  I was going to make this post about Amazon before I looked at the numbers. ",

        "selftext": "Als ich [diesen Post hier](https://www.reddit.com/r/automobil/comments/1o6av04/kleinwagen_wird_bedr%C3%A4ngt_limousine_nicht/) gelesen habe, habe ich mich sofort angesprochen gefühlt. Ich bin seit zwei Wochen stolzer Besitzer eines Firmenwagens: Ein Hyundai i10 mit 67 PS. Ja, kein Rennwagen, aber er reicht, um auf der Autobahn mitzuschwimmen und wenn man genug Geduld hat, läuft er auch 180. Ich fahre beruflich bedingt viel Autobahn. Privat dieses Wochenende auch, ein Familienmitglied liegt im Krankenhaus und ich musste daher ca. 800 km in zwei Tagen abreißen. Dabei gibt es auf der Autobahn fast täglich die gleichen Situationen, und es geht mir total auf den Sack. \n\nZweispurige Autobahn, ich hab gemütlich den Tempomat bei 130 drin. Es ist kaum jemand unterwegs, nur vereinzelt Autos. Ich kann im Spiegel locker 700 Meter nach hinten sehen, da ist niemand (aber eine kleine Kuppe). Vor mir fährt jemand nur 100, ich setze zum überholen an. Schon tut sich hinter der Kuppe ein Mercedes auf, der mit ca. 250 angeschossen kommt und mit LED-Blitzlichtgewitter auf nen Meter auffährt. Ich weiß nicht, wie er sich das vorgestellt hat. Ich bin gerade neben dem Auto. Was soll ich bitte machen? Gaspedal in die Ölwanne rammen um schnellstmöglich freie Bahn zu schaffen? Kumpel, ich hab 67 PS, da kann ichs auch gleich lassen. Bremsen und den Überholvorgang abbrechen? Passt dir wahrscheinlich noch weniger. Das andere Fahrzeug von der Bahn rammen, damit du voran kommst? Wäre illegal und gefährlich. \n\nAuf der Rückfahrt wieder zweispurig, wieder 130 Tempomat. Vor mir ein Audi, der so 120 fährt. Niemand hinter mir. Ich blinke und fahre auf die linke Spur. Wir sind auf einer Höhe und der Audi-Fahrer beschleunigt. Ich breche den Überholvorgang ab, schere wieder hinter ihm ein. Er wird wieder langsamer bis er wieder bei 120 ist. Das Spiel wiederholen wir dreimal. Beim vierten Mal habe ich die Schnauze voll, ich schalte in den Vierten und beschleunige bis 150, bevor ich endlich vor ihm einscheren kann. Lasse mich auf 130 zurückfallen, und anscheinend hat er meine Existenz nun vergessen, denn er fährt mit 120 weiter und wird im Rückspiegel immer kleiner. \n\nAndere Situation: Ich habe den Tempomat diesmal bei 120 drin, bin etwas müde und will nur in Ruhe nach Hause rollen. Vor mir mit ausreichend Abstand ein BMW, auch 120 Tempomat. So fahren wir gemeinsam eine ganze Weile (ca. 10 km), hinter mir gesellt sich ein Tesla dazu und wir fahren zu dritt mit entspannten 120 in Richtung Horizont. An besagtem Horizont erscheint ein Auto mit Anhänger, den wir überholen wollen. Der BMW blinkt und schert aus, ich setze den Blinker und bin bereits am Spurwechseln, als dem Tesla-Fahrer wohl einfällt: \"Warte mal! Das ist ja ein Kleinwagen! Wie kann es sein, dass das Hartz IV-Mobil vor mir fährt?\" - klar, wir können 10 km zusammen 120 fahren, aber kaum will ich überholen, muss er natürlich beschleunigen und an mir vorbei, sodass ich bremsen und mich erst wieder auf 120 hochkämpfen muss. Und dann noch dumm gucken, wenn ich ihn beim vorbeifahren anhupe. \n\nWer hat solchen Gestalten denn ins Gehirn geschissen? Meine Fresse ich will doch auch nur irgendwann ankommen, ich hab kein Interesse dran, mit euch noch einen Kleinkrieg anzufangen!",

        "title": "Súlyos elektromos autó baleset borzolja a kedélyeket Kínában",
        "selftext": "A Xiaomi legújabb elektromos csúcsmodellje, a több mint 1500 lóerős SU7 Ultra Csengtuban egy betonfalnak ütközött, majd kigyulladt. Hiába próbálták kinyitni az ajtókat, azok zárva maradtak, pedig ezeknél a járműveknél egy baleset után automatikus nyitási mechanizmusnak kellene működnie. A sofőrön így nem tudtak segíteni. A tragédia nagy visszhangot váltott ki Kínában, ahol a Xiaomi részvényei a reggeli kereskedésben 6,5 százalékot estek. A gyártó eddig azzal is hirdette magát, hogy akkumulátorai gyakorlatilag tűzbiztosak, és a biztonsági rendszerek minden körülmények között lehetővé teszik a mentést.\n\nEgy Tesla szeptember 7-én letért az útról, majd a baleset következtében kigyulladt. Az online megosztott képek alapján egy Model S-ről van szó, ami azt jelenti, hogy teljesen elektromos, kiugró ajtókilincsekkel rendelkezik. Egy férfi a helyszínre rohant, és megpróbálta megmenteni az utasokat, de nem tudta kinyitni az ajtókat. A Tesla a növekvő kritikákkal és nyomással szembesülve most azt állítja, hogy most az ajtókilincsek új kialakításán dolgozik. A mérnökök egy egygombos rendszert fejlesztenek, amely ötvözi a manuális és az elektronikus kioldást, és amelynek célja, hogy az ajtókat ne csak a sofőrök, de a hozzájuk érkező mentők is ki tudják nyitni kívülről.\n\nNem csak az Egyesült Államokban indul vizsgálat a Tesla elektromos kilincsei miatt. Nemrégiben kiderült, hogy az amerikai biztonsági hatóságok eljárást indítottak a Model Y kilincsei miatt, miután több nyugtalanító incidens is történt, amikor a szülők nem fértek hozzá gyermekeikhez az autókban. A német rendőrség ugyanezt a kialakítást hozta összefüggésbe egy balesettel, amelyben egy sofőr és két gyermek meghalt a hónap elején.\n\nA Tesla kezelési utasításában a gyártó felhívja a tulajdonosok figyelmét arra, hogy vészhelyzet esetén az ajtók akkor is nyithatóak, ha az elektromos rendszer csődöt mond. Minden autóban mechanikusan is nyitható a zár: a Model S-nél az első ajtókat az ablakemelő kapcsolók előtti elem meghúzásával lehet oldani, a hátsó ajtókat pedig a hátsó ülések előtt lévő szőnyeg alatt lévő kábel meghúzásával lehet kinyitni.",

        "selftext": "I saw this chart on car values, and it really messes up the idea that \"all cars are a bad investment.\" If you want a fast, cool car that is also a surprisingly smart way to spend your money, this data points straight to Porsche.\n\nThe King of all cars for holding its value is the Porsche 911. It only loses 19.5% of its original price over five years. To give you an idea, the normal new car loses more than half of its value in that same time.\n\nThe most surprising part is seeing the 911 next to other fancy cars and electric cars. The Porsche 911 is the champion of keeping its value, but the electric luxury cars are the biggest losers. For example, the Tesla Model S loses a huge 65.2% of its value. Other luxury sedans like the BMW 7 Series lose 67.1%! The absolute worst car on the list is the Jaguar I-PACE, which loses a shocking 72.2% of its price in just five years.\n\nEven the Porsches that cost less are heroes. The Porsche 718 Cayman also holds its value really well, losing only 21.8%. That means it loses less money than a Toyota Tacoma, a Chevrolet Corvette, and even a Honda Civic!\n\nBasically, if you want a fun, fancy car without throwing away tons of money, buying a Porsche might actually be the smartest choice.",

Figured this sub would appreciate pictures showing what you’d really be living with, not just the Nissan-PR-approved shots.  \n\nNote: this is the loaded-trim level in the showroom.  \n\nOutside: honestly I’m a much bigger fan of the styling seeing it in person than I was from press releases. The headlight bar looks sleek but the tail lights really take the cake.  \n\nIt sports a front camera and two rears - one for parking and one for the rear view mirror. I’m not sure I’m a fan of that aspect  as it seems overly redundant and more parts to break, but it’s how the car comes.  \n\nBeing Japan this is of course right-hand drive. I bring this up as the J1772 port is on the right - I’m unsure if this is always on the right or the driver’s side (so left in the US). The quick charge port is still a Chademo which was confirmed to, again, be part of the Japanese-sold variant. Other variants would sport the NACS port.  \n\nSide note: I’ve seen mainly Leafs/Ariyas here of course but also more Teslas, VWs, and Hyundais than I was imagining. Even found a Waymo once!  \n\nFront seat: very spacious, especially compared to the current Leaf (I have a 2024). Beautiful layout, mixed physical and touch buttons. I’m not a fan of the A/C controls being touch buttons, too much fiddling when drivers should be focused. There also now seat-position buttons so you and another driver can preset your preferences (my wife’s Subaru includes this feature and it’s not something I knew I wanted until we had it).  \n\nUnfortunately the glovebox and center console are still comically undersized, but it does include a wireless charging pad now so that’s nice.  \n\nInterestingly the head rests are where the speakers are integrated, featuring Bose! I’m not sure if this is a common feature elsewhere but I didn’t see this when shopping for my wife’s car last year.  \n\nBackseat: also very, very spacious. Most importantly, NO MORE HUMP! A REAL MIDDLE SEAT! Also 120V now in the cabin and the glass ceiling is a nice touch, albeit will need to be well tinted in hotter climates.  \n\nAs a bonus I got to see Nissan 2024 e-prix racer, a Fairlady Z, and Godzilla himself.",

And we don't have a choice against this. I would like the Westons' to get at least as much as Zuckerberg, because 1) Facebook is optional, unlike groceries , 2) OUR TAXES BAIL OUT WESTON ALL THE FRIKKIN TIME!\n\nWhat about the Irvings?\n\nWhat about the massive Tesla showroom being built right now in East Vancouver by Ryan Beedie (of all the crap that has the Beedie name plastered on it, as if he is an epitome of being Canadian.)\n\nEvery week, for months now, there has been an anti-Tesla protest in Vancouver. This is fucking stupid, because Ryan Beedie laughs at you all the way to the bank.\n\nWhat is the point of screaming outside the US embassy, when the damage is being done by born-and-raised Canadians?\n\nHow many Canadians trying to not shop at Walmart or Amazon, and then have to pay so much more for the same product at a Loblaw's-owned shop?\n\nAnd, lastly, what of the Chinese resident/non-resident billionaire who is buying up HBC ? She lives in Vancouver, in a mansion on the west-side, but pays no taxes, because she can be a unicorn who is both resident and non-resident.\n\nInstead of performing outrage at people in other countries, how about we start making a real change at home?\n\nThis is not about politics. I am sure whether you are Blue, Red, Orange, Green - you don't like being gouged on paying $10 more for shampoo, just because Galen Weston wants a new yacht.\n\nWorking-class Canadians, even if we are divided by politics, work hard for their money. And our work is what makes the country function.\n\nHell, the TFWs work harder than the billionaire parasites that hire them. Why can't there be at least as much hate towards the cause of the problem, rather than the schmucks being exploited by them?\n\nNo one deserves to be fucked over, to feed the already obscenely bloated wealthy parasites that prosper off dividing our country.\n\nI just wish Beedie will get more hate the Zuckerberg, because Beedie prospered off OUR money and is ruining our country from the inside.\n\nEdit:  \nHad to add, because how could I forget:\n\nKevin O'Leary, the gross dude who went with Jordan Peterson, and Marlaina Smith to the orange pdfile's inauguration...  Where's the hate? It's very performative to hate on US billionaires, but hear crickets when it comes to our own parasites.)\n\n2nd edit: There seems to be a bit of \"better ours than others\".  This is like covering up and enabling an abusive family member, while shaming the victim into keeping it a secret, while claiming that \"others outside the family\" are much worse, so it's better to keep being diddled by your relative, because \"they are family.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "How much do Magnificent 7 Senior SWEs make?",
        "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nWanted to show off the new box plot charts we have on our site by compiling the charts for equivalently leveled Senior SWEs at the Mag 7 companies (Meta, Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla). I thought the charts themselves already revealed some pretty interesting similarities and differences between the companies and their compensation, but here are some more of my detailed notes after looking at these charts:\n\n**Meta E5** \\- Widest spread of all with outliers on the low end at around \\~$244k and outliers at the high end reaching \\~$750k. Meta is already well-known to be one of the highest-paying companies even among the Mag 7 list, and with their recent stock run-up too, their wide pay range is likely a product of how long the engineer’s tenure is and what the stock price was whenever they happened to join.\n\n**Google L5** \\- Distribution is a bit tighter. The interquartile range only stretches about \\~$65k from $385k to $451k with the median being $416k. Aside from some outliers in the $500k range, the majority of Senior SWEs at Google seem to land somewhere between $350k and $450k. When compared to Meta, this again could just be a difference in stock performance as of late, and possibly a reflection of the company's hiring/promotion philosophy.\n\n**Amazon SDE III** \\- Similar to Meta, Amazon has a pretty wide range of compensation figures, going from $210k at the bottom to $652k at the top. Amazon’s higher average YoE for their Senior Engineer level may be the culprit here. The compensation range may be wider due to needing to accommodate a wider talent pool.\n\n**Nvidia IC4** \\- Nvidia and the other AI chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom traditionally don't give out large equity packages in their offers. But, due to the AI boom, we saw Nvidia's stock grow at an insane rate, likely causing anyone who joined around \\~2-3 years ago being at the higher end of that IQR, and anyone joining more recently being on the lower end. Plus, Nvidia's recent shift to front-loaded vesting also meant initial equity grants are smaller than they used to be, leading to such a wide range between the 25th and 75th percentile of data points.\n\nThese new boxplots are available on the live Levels.fyi site, you can check out Google's L5 page, for example, here: [https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer/levels/l5](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer/levels/l5)",

This year thru a little luck, we got the opportunity to explore private schools and my daughter got into a pretty kick ass, all girls school. We were public from year K thru 5. Kid got accepted to her first choice. \n\nWe qualify for financial aid (about 55% of the tuition) and my mother in law, who lives in CA and had CA money, is covering a good chunk of what's left. We count our blessings and know we got lucky.\n\nHere's the rub. My kiddo suddenly feels poor. She's a great kid, fairly well adjusted, funny, whip smart. But we're going to a school where some of the Seniors girls drive Teslas. (I drive an 2003 Jetta that's falling apart, but it's paid for and that's a feature no Tesla cars can match.)\n\nI'm no class warrior . The school is very academically rigorous and they do a great job at bringing in kids from across the income spectrum. Even the wealthy families we've met are kind, down-to-earth people. But that doesn't change that most are pretty affluent. \n\nAnyhow, we've told our daughter that we aren't rich and that's nothing to be ashamed of. But she still mentions feeling uncomfortable with our house size, our older cars, etc. \n\nI'm just curious how any of y'all have dealt with these kinds of feeling from their kids.\n\nEDIT: Obligatory \"I'm blown away by all the amazing advice I got here\" comment. Thank you all. I am reading them all and wish I had time to thank everyone personally. Y'all never cease to amaze me.",

Also I build own basket of stocks to trade this rather than trading on whole 100 stocks. I prefer to stick to large caps because that feels safer to me. And since not all stocks in my basket are active together - capital is not an issue.\nI've attached a 1 year return as well as 3 year return for s&p 100. Also shown how it looks on TV.

        "selftext": "Today, Lucid Motors has tipped the iceberg on my overall opinion on the car and brand. I’ve had a ‘23 Air Touring since January of 2023, and this car is truly a piece of sh*t. Whether it’s the door handles not opening, infotainment screen randomly blacking out, cameras lagging on reverse, app not working to use the car remotely, or music just not playing; there is always something going wrong with the car. To preface, I have already opened a lemon law case with this car, but today was so baffling to me that I had to write about it.\n\nI got in my car as normal this morning, decided to stop for a drink at 7-11, and upon getting back in my car, there was a steering fault warning. This car randomly gives alerts that go away, so I drove it the rest of the way to work. I call Lucid while doing so, and they informed me that the vehicle needed to be towed and to call roadside assistance. I call roadside assistance, and I am put on hold for 5 minutes. I then choose the option to receive a callback - they called me back 15 minutes later… ON A ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE ISSUE.\n\nI was then told I would need to pick up a car from Enterprise rental. It took an hour for them to give me the keys to the car… This part may not be Lucid’s responsibility, but it just added salt to the wound.\n\nOverall, this is my 7th or 8th terrible experience with this company, and I am so done with it. I have put 37,000 miles on the car, and I can honestly say I enjoyed 5,000 miles, but the other 32,000 miles were absolute hell. Not to mention, scheduling any service is a 30+ day lead time in my area…\n\nThis car is not only an inconvenience, but an embarrassment to drive. (Just the other day I sat in the rain for 2 minutes trying to get my doors open). I have owned multiple Teslas and still own a Model Y, 10/10 times I have chose the Model Y over the Lucid when it is not being used by my brother. \n\nFair warning to any potential buyers - maybe the newer cars have gotten better, but this is my completely honest review of the car.",

        "selftext": "I wasn’t planning on getting a second Tesla as my “mom car” and was originally planning on getting another gas/ hybrid SUV because of road trips, but I fell in love with the Model X plaid the other day at the dealership in this exact color. I have a full size 7 seater Land Rover Discovery I’m going to trade in soon when the warranty is up because, well LR! I love the size  and comfort of it though! \n\nThe X felt surprisingly roomy when I sat in it. I thought it would be too small coming from a Discovery but I was shocked at how much space there is especially with the six seater! I feel like the captain seats make it more spacious. \n\nWe have a 5 year old son, another baby boy on the way in early 2026, and an 85 lb Bernedoodle (who we don’t drive with daily but we take him on outings to the dog beach and the occasional road or camping trip). \n\nSpam me with all the pros and cons! We have a MYP as our other car and both love it. It is pricey but the free supercharging for life makes it seem like a good deal? We’re test driving it overnight this week. I’m excited! ",

        "title": "BUYER BEWARE: Dodge Charger Daytona - Numerous Issues - Lack of Support.",
        "selftext": "Hello reddit,\n\nI'm writing this post to document my ownership experience with the Dodge Charger Daytona, and to warn others from purchasing anything electric from Stellantis. This is my own experience, and to those who have had a positive ownership with the Daytona I'm glad. In my opinion the car drives and performs phenomenally.. when it works. To add I live in the DMV area.\n\nSo here's a short summary of the issues I've been having:\n\n\\- Does not charge consistently at stations. I've used Electrify America, Blink, Chargepoint, and attempted to use Tesla chargers.\n\n\\- Seat issue, the recline has nearly squished my rear seat passengers multiple times. If you cannot get out of the back seat in mere seconds, I don't even recommend people getting back there.\n\n\\- Vehicle pushed through the brakes into an intersection. All safety lights came on (Collision control, traction control, red turtle for limp mode I assume) Then refused to turn back on for a few minutes. Almost like a big cammed car would push through brakes, lurched into traffic and left the front end of the car sitting on a busy roadway.\n\nTo explain further on each:\n\n**Charging issues**\n\nI have not been able to charge the vehicle consistently at any stations since purchase in 8/28. I would get nonstop errors, having to un-plug and re-plug in the vehicle every 5-10%, sometimes not even working at all. I've been left stranded with less than 5% left and when I returned to the dealership to get an emergency charge just to get home they called the police on me and trespassed me from their lot.. I've only been able to get it to work at a tesla charger once. I've used multiple different adapters from Amazon including the Dewalt and Lectron adapters. The only one that's worked so far is the charger in Easton, MD with the magic dock connector already installed. I had to tell the app I was a Cadillac Lyric to get it to work as well. I was supposed to get a free home charger with the purchase of the vehicle however I have still not been given that yet either. I travel a lot for work, and having inconsistent charging does not give me any confidence what-so-ever to use this on a day to day basis. I was stuck in West Chester, PA for over 2 hours having to un-plug and re-initiate the charging at a Chargepoint charger just to get enough to take it back to the dealership. It works when it wants to, which is less than 15% of the time.\n\n**Seat issue**\n\nI've had this issue since day one. At first I thought it was from having the seats back in the furthest most position, but after testing its not. One of my friends legs got caught when trying to get out causing him to fall. Another's entire body was pinched because they cant get out in under 5 seconds.. If you have children do NOT put them in the back if you are having this issue. There is no safety mechanism in place and you have to way for the seat to go back all the way and reset the setback to get it to move forward again. Quickest solution I've found to get someone out in this situation is to allow it to fully adjust back, and manually adjusting the seat forward. Which is insane to me that they have to sit in discomfort and potentially pain!\n\n**Vehicle pushing through brakes**\n\nThis was the last straw for me. I was willing to work with both Stellantis and the dealership on the other issues because I genuinely enjoyed the car. But when it put me at risk like that I cannot tolerate it. I do not feel safe operating the vehicle anymore. I was sitting at an exit from a store waiting to pull out into an intersection. Full foot on the brake, and I know for certain I wasn't accidentally hitting the accelerator because on the first \"jump\" I checked to make sure. It lurched through the brakes multiple times bucking like a cammed car would. Then threw all these warning lights, turtle icon came up saying speed limited, and the collision lights came on as well as traction control was disabled. Shut off and wouldn't power back on for a few minutes leaving the entire front half of my car sitting in oncoming traffic.\n\n**All this being said here are the responses I've received from the Dealer and Stellantis:**\n\nService writer is stating that the car is the most up to date car in the nation. The first time I checked it in they had it for 4 days, and updated a total of 9 modules. I took it to test and it worked for the first few days, then all the charging issues came back. The seats were never fixed. I spoke with the technician and he said I shouldn't have even bought the car.. The car is throwing over 40 fault codes, and keep coming back. Dealer stated that they are \"unofficial recalls\". It was explained to me that when they pull codes its supposed to give them a repair list of potential fixes and there are none. He stated that even Stellantis reps that are driving these cars as \"demos\" constantly bring them in for service for the same issues including the Wagoneer EV.\n\nStellantis has denied my buy back claim, the first time I checked it in for service the dealer does not have any loaner vehicles so I had to rent a vehicle and get reimbursed from Stellantis. They would only cover up to $60 a day for a rental where the cheapest I found was $80 for a sub compact... I still have yet to see that reimbursement check. The car has been sitting at the dealership now for over 3 weeks. I have been without a car. The only thing Stellantis is offering is rental reimbursement but I cant afford to frontload $1800 a month in rental fees + car payment. Its ridiculous for them to ask me to do this. When I call for updates the Stellantis rep said \"You don't have to call us as frequently for updates, we will call you when we have new information\"\n\nStellantis is stating they are expediting parts to fix the issues I'm having, however when I talk with the dealership they are stating that parts will not fix the issue and that it is entirely software related.\n\nWhen I attempted to get out of the car myself because I've explained multiple times that I drive over 30k miles a year and my job depends on me being able to travel the DMV/DE/PA area I was told by the dealership that I'm over 20k flipped in the car and that they recommended I communicate with service to get the issue resolved. I understand EV's tank in value day one but I also assumed buying a brand new car I wouldn't have something I can't depend on during the beginning of ownership.. When I stated this to the Sales Manager he flat out told me that I should've done my research first before purchasing the car, and said that's why he couldn't sell the one he has on his showroom floor.\n\nFor reference I will avoid dropping the names of the employees, however I will state that I bought the car from Heritage CDJR in Parkville, MD, and I've been doing all the service through my local dealer at Heritage CDJR in Owings Mills, MD. When I informed sales that there were no loaners available I asked to use a used car and they chuckled and said no. Understandable to an extent however I used to work for the Heritage organization and we did this more times than I could count for clients I had in the past. Parkville CDJR sales said I should continue bugging service instead of trying to trade out of the car and has since then stopped returning my calls. My buy back claim through Stellantis was denied. Stellantis offered reimbursement of some degree, wouldn't put any numerical value on it, and said they could only issue it after I pick up the vehicle from the dealer. So I am now paying for a vehicle that I cannot use. I've explained to them that I am a commission based employee and not being able to travel and sell is preventing me from creating any income currently. I also explained that my employer is upset and considering letting me go because I am unable to my job to the full extent. All I get back is \"sorry sir we are trying the best we can\"\n\nI'm at a loss with options, and I just want to warn anyone considering purchasing or leasing this vehicle. I unfortunately went the purchase route since I drive so many miles a year. I've been documenting this process with photos and text. I will update further when I receive more information. Thanks to those who took the time to read my post! Please share this if you could as the only recommendation I got from the Service team was to \"publish my experience to social media because Stellantis doesn't like it\"\n\nTLDR: Nonstop mechanical issues, charging issues, and safety issues. No offer of support from Dealership or Stellantis. Buyers Beware.",

Tuttavia, per volontà superiore e in nome dell’ordine, l’apertura è stata rinviata a data da destinarsi, generando tra la popolazione fervore e patriottico stupore.\n\nMa il destino, come spesso accade nelle grandi epopee del popolo italiano, ha deciso di mettere alla prova i suoi figli più devoti.\n\nIl portale, annunciato da giorni come la via maestra verso il progresso ecologico, non ha aperto.\n\nNonostante ciò, il popolo non si è dato per vinto!

They’re powering the EV revolution and securing the U.S. grid — because every megawatt stored is now a matter of national security.\n\n**🪨 Rare Earths & Strategic Metals**\n\nChina still holds 70%+ market share — but the U.S. is fighting back.

        "selftext": "Two Different Paths to Keep EV Motors Cool\n\nBoth Tesla and General Motors have engineered effective cooling solutions for their electric motors — but each comes with unique tradeoffs and engineering considerations.\n\nTesla’s high-pressure oil delivery system offers precise, targeted cooling to critical motor components, especially the core where heat buildup is most severe. It’s a smart solution for maintaining optimal temperatures, though the added power demand from the oil pump can slightly reduce overall efficiency and range.\n\nMeanwhile, GM’s gravity-fed oil distribution system takes a more passive approach — using the vehicle’s natural motion and existing lubrication flow to deliver cooling oil. It’s inherently more energy-efficient but demands greater engineering precision to ensure consistent performance under all conditions.\n\nAt Munro & Associates, we specialize in uncovering these kinds of engineering insights — analyzing design decisions, tradeoffs, and system efficiencies that drive innovation across the EV industry.\n\nIf you’re as fascinated by the details behind EV motor design as we are, check out our latest breakdown on Munro Live for a deeper dive into how these systems work.\n\nSource: [Munro / LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/munro-%26-associates_munrolive-munroandassociates-tesla-activity-7382449687913512960-HnM_?utm_source=share)",

        "selftext": "This never really occurred to me until today, but I'm bored and my mind is wandering.  Regular cars use vacuum boosters for their brakes, where the vacuum is generated by the engine, but since Tesla's don't have that, they must be doing it a different way.  Seems they're commonly using Bosch's iBooster, which essentially does the same thing by generating extra force electrically.\n\nNot that I've ever had an issue with the brakes, but my question is, since the ability is clearly there, why is there no adjustability for brake force?  You can pick light/medium/heavy for steering feel, since it's obviously electrically assisted power steering.  So why not the same for brakes?  Maybe not for all models, but I would think at least the Plaid, which has drag strip mode, and various suspension adjustments, would have adjustable brake force as an option.\n\nIf nothing else, I'm sure it's at least being varied to keep brake feel consistent, but I never hear anything about this.  You'd think adjustable brake force would be an easy one to implement and give Tesla yet another feature that most cars don't have.",

        "title": "BUYER BEWARE: Dodge Charger Daytona - Numerous Issues - Lack of Support.",
        "selftext": "Hello reddit,\n\nI'm writing this post to document my ownership experience with the Dodge Charger Daytona, and to warn others from purchasing anything electric from Stellantis. This is my own experience, and to those who have had a positive ownership with the Daytona I'm glad. In my opinion the car drives and performs phenomenally.. when it works. To add I live in the DMV area.\n\nSo here's a short summary of the issues I've been having:\n\n\\- Does not charge consistently at stations. I've used Electrify America, Blink, Chargepoint, and attempted to use Tesla chargers.\n\n\\- Seat issue, the recline has nearly squished my rear seat passengers multiple times. If you cannot get out of the back seat in mere seconds, I don't even recommend people getting back there.\n\n\\- Vehicle pushed through the brakes into an intersection. All safety lights came on (Collision control, traction control, red turtle for limp mode I assume) Then refused to turn back on for a few minutes. Almost like a big cammed car would push through brakes, lurched into traffic and left the front end of the car sitting on a busy roadway.\n\nTo explain further on each:\n\n**Charging issues**\n\nI have not been able to charge the vehicle consistently at any stations since purchase in 8/28. I would get nonstop errors, having to un-plug and re-plug in the vehicle every 5-10%, sometimes not even working at all. I've been left stranded with less than 5% left and when I returned to the dealership to get an emergency charge just to get home they called the police on me and trespassed me from their lot.. I've only been able to get it to work at a tesla charger once. I've used multiple different adapters from Amazon including the Dewalt and Lectron adapters. The only one that's worked so far is the charger in Easton, MD with the magic dock connector already installed. I had to tell the app I was a Cadillac Lyric to get it to work as well. I was supposed to get a free home charger with the purchase of the vehicle however I have still not been given that yet either. I travel a lot for work, and having inconsistent charging does not give me any confidence what-so-ever to use this on a day to day basis. I was stuck in West Chester, PA for over 2 hours having to un-plug and re-initiate the charging at a Chargepoint charger just to get enough to take it back to the dealership. It works when it wants to, which is less than 15% of the time.\n\n**Seat issue**\n\nI've had this issue since day one. At first I thought it was from having the seats back in the furthest most position, but after testing its not. One of my friends legs got caught when trying to get out causing him to fall. Another's entire body was pinched because they cant get out in under 5 seconds.. If you have children do NOT put them in the back if you are having this issue. There is no safety mechanism in place and you have to way for the seat to go back all the way and reset the setback to get it to move forward again. Quickest solution I've found to get someone out in this situation is to allow it to fully adjust back, and manually adjusting the seat forward. Which is insane to me that they have to sit in discomfort and potentially pain!\n\n**Vehicle pushing through brakes**\n\nThis was the last straw for me. I was willing to work with both Stellantis and the dealership on the other issues because I genuinely enjoyed the car. But when it put me at risk like that I cannot tolerate it. I do not feel safe operating the vehicle anymore. I was sitting at an exit from a store waiting to pull out into an intersection. Full foot on the brake, and I know for certain I wasn't accidentally hitting the accelerator because on the first \"jump\" I checked to make sure. It lurched through the brakes multiple times bucking like a cammed car would. Then threw all these warning lights, turtle icon came up saying speed limited, and the collision lights came on as well as traction control was disabled. Shut off and wouldn't power back on for a few minutes leaving the entire front half of my car sitting in oncoming traffic.\n\n**All this being said here are the responses I've received from the Dealer and Stellantis:**\n\nService writer is stating that the car is the most up to date car in the nation. The first time I checked it in they had it for 4 days, and updated a total of 9 modules. I took it to test and it worked for the first few days, then all the charging issues came back. The seats were never fixed. I spoke with the technician and he said I shouldn't have even bought the car.. The car is throwing over 40 fault codes, and keep coming back. Dealer stated that they are \"unofficial recalls\". It was explained to me that when they pull codes its supposed to give them a repair list of potential fixes and there are none. He stated that even Stellantis reps that are driving these cars as \"demos\" constantly bring them in for service for the same issues including the Wagoneer EV.\n\nStellantis has denied my buy back claim, the first time I checked it in for service the dealer does not have any loaner vehicles so I had to rent a vehicle and get reimbursed from Stellantis. They would only cover up to $60 a day for a rental where the cheapest I found was $80 for a sub compact... I still have yet to see that reimbursement check. The car has been sitting at the dealership now for over 3 weeks. I have been without a car. The only thing Stellantis is offering is rental reimbursement but I cant afford to frontload $1800 a month in rental fees + car payment. Its ridiculous for them to ask me to do this. When I call for updates the Stellantis rep said \"You don't have to call us as frequently for updates, we will call you when we have new information\"\n\nStellantis is stating they are expediting parts to fix the issues I'm having, however when I talk with the dealership they are stating that parts will not fix the issue and that it is entirely software related.\n\nWhen I attempted to get out of the car myself because I've explained multiple times that I drive over 30k miles a year and my job depends on me being able to travel the DMV/DE/PA area I was told by the dealership that I'm over 20k flipped in the car and that they recommended I communicate with service to get the issue resolved. I understand EV's tank in value day one but I also assumed buying a brand new car I wouldn't have something I can't depend on during the beginning of ownership.. When I stated this to the Sales Manager he flat out told me that I should've done my research first before purchasing the car, and said that's why he couldn't sell the one he has on his showroom floor.\n\nFor reference I will avoid dropping the names of the employees, however I will state that I bought the car from Heritage CDJR in Parkville, MD, and I've been doing all the service through my local dealer at Heritage CDJR in Owings Mills, MD. When I informed sales that there were no loaners available I asked to use a used car and they chuckled and said no. Understandable to an extent however I used to work for the Heritage organization and we did this more times than I could count for clients I had in the past. Parkville CDJR sales said I should continue bugging service instead of trying to trade out of the car and has since then stopped returning my calls. My buy back claim through Stellantis was denied. Stellantis offered reimbursement of some degree, wouldn't put any numerical value on it, and said they could only issue it after I pick up the vehicle from the dealer. So I am now paying for a vehicle that I cannot use. I've explained to them that I am a commission based employee and not being able to travel and sell is preventing me from creating any income currently. I also explained that my employer is upset and considering letting me go because I am unable to my job to the full extent. All I get back is \"sorry sir we are trying the best we can\"\n\nI'm at a loss with options, and I just want to warn anyone considering purchasing or leasing this vehicle. I unfortunately went the purchase route since I drive so many miles a year. I've been documenting this process with photos and text. I will update further when I receive more information. Thanks to those who took the time to read my post! Please share this if you could as the only recommendation I got from the Service team was to \"publish my experience to social media because Stellantis doesn't like it\"\n\nTLDR: Nonstop mechanical issues, charging issues, and safety issues. No offer of support from Dealership or Stellantis. Buyers Beware.",

        "title": "My husband says I shouldn’t spend more than $15K on a car even though he drives a $74K Tesla",
        "selftext": "\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy husband (37 M)and I (33 F) have been together for 5 years and married since December 2024. I’m a school therapist in Los Angeles, just starting my career and making around $70K. I only work 9½ months out of the year, which has been great. My husband is a tax attorney who’s been in the field for nearly a decade. He recently started a new job in Encinitas (North County San Diego), making about $220K (he made $240K before). He rents an ADU down there with a 10-minute commute.\n\nI stayed in LA for the school year since I just started my job, and I’m living with my mom to save money. We plan to start trying for kids by late 2026.\n\nRight now, I drive a 2014 Mini Cooper that I love. it’s reliable, fun, and still in great condition, but it’s small and about to hit 100K miles. I want to upgrade to something slightly bigger and electric/hybrid, since I drive a lot (including the long trips to see him). In our relationship, I have always been driving to him up until we live together, but now that he moved away, I know I am expected to drive to him more often than he’s going to. There isn’t much pressure to do that but if I don’t drive to him, I know we’re just gonna get stuck seeing each other once a month    Now and I want see him more.  \n\nAnyways, I’ve been looking at used EVs (2020–2023) like the Tesla Model Y, Audi Q4, VW ID.4, or Prius, in the $18K–$27K range. I do want something kinda luxury like the Audi or the VW and I’m pretty OK with how the Tesla Y looks as well just because I know it’s gonna look pretty good after a decade. My mini Cooper looks fantastic after 10 years. The paint looks great so I do want to invest in a nice car that I really appreciate. I know EVs depreciate in value amf that’s something that my husband also brought up but I’m looking more for a car that I love and enjoy. I also looked into maintenance and cost of these cars so I feel like I’m prepared for it. I’m also expected to grow in my income as I just started in my field.  \n\nHere’s the part that’s been bothering me: my husband bought a brand-new Tesla Model Y in 2022, directly from Tesla, with Full Self-Driving and a 3.5% interest rate. It cost around $74K. I don’t hold that against him, he bought it within his means, and it’s a nice car but when I mentioned wanting something in the $25K range, he told me I should only spend $15K on a car.\n\nHe said, “We’re married, so we’re making the payments,” even though the payment would come out of my income. I told him, “Then I should take the Tesla since I’m the one driving more miles,” and he didn’t argue, just said no with no explanation.\n\nFor context, we don’t have joint accounts. He added me to two of his credit cards (Amex for groceries and Citi for gas/restaurants), but I usually spend around $500–600/month total, and I typically check with him before larger purchases over $100, his request. I don’t feel reckless with money, but I do feel like he’s controlling my financial decisions more than he should. The only time I’ve been ex excessive with money was when I bought an $800 used Chloe purse when I was in grad school a couple years ago and my husband still brings that up. I wasn’t really making income then and living off loans, but I bought it when I started my internship. I also want to mention I have student loans but im  able to pay them now with my income and one of the loans have a high interest up to 8% but I’m paying that loan off right now in large payments. \n\nI get that interest rates are high right now, and yes, I could save more. But I also want a comfortable, safe, nice car since I drive a lot and take care of my things. To me, buying a $25K car on my income doesn’t seem excessive especially when he’s driving a $74K one.\n\nSo, I’m wondering:\nAm I being unreasonable for wanting a car that’s nice and within my own means, or is he being too controlling about this?\n\nEdit: If I buy a car I would be selling mine for about 6k. OK someone mentioned my debt. My debt is 80 K right now (some of the interest is as low as 4% and one or two loans are seven and 8% ) and I’m putting huge chunks of money into it every time I get paid. My husband also has debt as well from law school. His is I think 150k right now and pays 2k a month on it. \n\nI never really thought about buying another car until my father-in-law started making comments about mine to my husband, suggesting I should get something more reliable. But my car has been reliable to me at least so far.  I’m assuming it’s because he knows I’ll be driving down to visit my husband. At first, I ignored it, but after he mentioned it a few more times, and it seemed like my husband was agreeing with it as well I started seriously considering it. I also just wanna add that my husband bought his Tesla car when he’s working for a home for the during the last five years. He didn’t really need but I guess cause the interest rate was really good. He decided to get it and also he liked all the tech stuff since he’s into that.\n\nI also want to stress my husband does have anxiety with money but he also very financially literate hence he’s a tax attorney; something I really love about him but sometimes it can make him stressed (irritable/snappy). I do agree with him that I should pay all cash for a car that is 15k but at the same time I don’t really need to get a car all. I just don’t want a car I don’t like. I love my car I have right now. \n\nUPDATE: I’m not gonna buy another because I don’t really need it and I want to keep focusing on paying off my debt. The advice was super helpful. Also I made a mistake on the Tesla price and assumed he paid 74k on the Tesla in 2022 but I think it was 2021 and it was a lot cheaper. Sorry y’all. Thanks for shaking some sense into me and for offering marital advice on communication and teamwork. ",

        "selftext": "Welcome to the era of solar roof tiles - a revolutionary technology that turns your entire roof into a clean, silent, and efficient power plant.\n\nSolar roof tiles, also known as solar shingles or slates, are not mounted on your roof - they are your roof. Designed to mimic traditional materials like slate or asphalt, each tile contains photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight into electricity.\n\nThe decision to upgrade to a solar roof comes with a host of immediate and long-term advantages:\n\n- Aesthetic Appeal: The number one benefit. Solar tiles blend seamlessly into your roofline, maintaining your home's architectural integrity. They are a game-changer for homes in conservation areas or for anyone who finds traditional panels visually intrusive.\n\n- Durability and Resilience: These aren't delicate accessories. Solar roof tiles are built to be your primary roofing material. They are extremely tough and engineered to withstand severe weather conditions, with many manufacturers offering warranties exceeding 25 years.\n\n- Significant Energy Savings: By generating your own electricity, you can drastically reduce or even eliminate your electricity bills. Some homeowners report savings of up to 64% on their energy costs.\n\n- Eco-Friendly Choice: You're directly reducing your carbon footprint by harnessing the sun's clean, renewable power. It's a powerful step towards a more sustainable lifestyle.\n\nChina is a global hub for solar technology, and several companies are at the forefront of producing these innovative roofing systems.\n\n1. Various Manufacturers on Made-in-China. Suppliers like ZJR-Ping offer a range of solar tiles, often with OEM/ODM services, allowing for customization. Ideal for bulk purchases. Website: https://m.made-in-china.com/\n\n2. Xiamen Universe. New Energy Offers integrated solar tile mounting systems compatible with brands like Tesla. Their systems are weatherproof and designed for a seamless aesthetic. Website: https://www.ui-newenergy.com/\n\n3. LONGi Solar. A world-leading solar technology brand. While known for panels, they produce high-efficiency solar cells and are a key player in the PV value chain, supplying technology that may be used in tile products. Website: https://www.longi.com/en/\n\n4. Suppliers on Alibaba (e.g., Singer-Ruser, Dalian Quacent). A platform with multiple verified suppliers. You can find companies specializing in stone-coated roof tiles integrated with solar technology, offering project design and customization. Website: https://www.alibaba.com/\n\nSolar roofing is a premium product. The initial investment is higher than for standard asphalt shingles or even conventional panel systems. It's crucial to view this as paying for two things at once: a brand new, durable roof and a home energy system.\n\nOn B2B platforms like Made-in-China, prices can be listed around $100 per piece, with minimum orders starting from 100 pieces, making it a significant investment geared towards projects or distributors. The final cost for a homeowner will depend on the system size, roof complexity, and installation labor. The installation process is more complex than a standard roof and can take over a week to complete, contributing to the overall cost.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the future of building-integrated solar technology?

        "selftext": "I just completed my first long road trip in my Lightning Flash that I bought last November. ~50 hours elapsed as we stopped a few times when the chargers were not near anything useful. My passenger and I switched off and made the trip without overnight stays. \n\n18 charges total - (4) Electrify America stations, (14) Tesla stations. Total cost was ~$530, efficiency per the trip calculator was 1.8mi/kwh. Mostly stayed around the speed limit or flow of traffic, slowed down a lot in Nebraska due to a strong headwind. \n\nWe had no issue with charger availability, I had to switch EA units a couple times as some capped at 130kW even though it was a 350kW station. No issues at Tesla chargers. My only complaint is the onboard navigation is totally useless for preconditioning when using Tesla chargers. I resorted to using ABRP to navigate, and thankfully the temperatures remained in a zone where preconditioning was not necessary at any stops. \n\nPaid for Bluecruise for this and it was worth it. I have previously done this drive in a 4Runner and it was miserable even stopping for 2 nights. The level of fatigue was minimal and made doing the trip non stop quite easy. We switched off every 5 hours or so. \n\nI now have 19k on the truck and still love it. We are driving back to UT in 2 weeks and may detour through CO for some better driving. ",

        "selftext": "Excerpts from the article [(archived here](https://archive.ph/T3tln#selection-2483.149-2483.429)):\n\n\"South Texas lured Tesla, along with Exxon Mobil and other energy behemoths, with the promise of land, cheap energy and, perhaps most critically, abundant water....\n\nNow, Corpus Christi, the region’s main water provider, says it is tapped out. A crippling drought is depleting its reservoirs, and the city expects it won’t be able to meet the area’s water demand in as soon as 18 months. In addition to industrial users, the water utility serves more than 500,000 people in seven counties....\n\n“The water situation in South Texas is about as dire as I’ve ever seen it,” said Mike Howard, chief executive of Howard Energy Partners, a private energy company that owns several facilities in Corpus Christi. “It has all the energy in the world, and it doesn’t have water.\"\n\n'The crisis could resonate beyond Corpus Christi, a city that is the eighth largest in Texas, by population, and sits just 150 miles from the Mexico border. Its refineries supply products to regional airports and markets in Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Texas and in Mexico. It is also home to a Navy base that hosts the world’s largest rotary-wing aircraft repair center, which services combat aircraft including Black Hawks....\n\nCorpus Christi is racing to build emergency projects and relieve pressure on the reservoirs. Just outside the city, it is pumping brackish groundwater from wells and discharging it into the Nueces River, which flows into a water treatment plant. At a second location further west, workers are busy drilling a dozen more wells in the scorching sun. Officials hope that the project will deliver about 28 million gallons of water a day within a year, which would only make up for some of the lost supplies from the reservoirs.\n\nCorpus Christi is considering other groundwater projects, as well as participating in a proposed desalination project on land owned by the Port of Corpus Christi. All these ventures are likely years away, would cost in the hundreds of millions and raise all customers’ water rates....\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe article also details the failed attempt to build a desalination plant, mostly due to the estimated construction cost skyrocketing by almost 60% between initial estimate and present day (current estimate $1.2 billion to build the plant), but political infighting also plays a role.\n\nWe've got it all here folks - human hubris, complete disregard of climate change & climate change projections (whether the drought resolves this time or not, the future for south Texas & water is....just like this), attempts to 'solve' the problem through technological means that are out-of-site expensive & create even more problems downstream, infighting, etc.",

It inspires me to take routes off the beaten path. The premise of the app is that the world is fogged in and you \"defog\" as you go. You also collect badges and unlock levels. Check out r/FogofWorld for more info\n\n  \nAs for all these road trips, they were fun but a lot of driving! This year we're hoping to explore northern California and Oregon. We are planning a long trip from LA to New Jersey via a Southern route to go through Georgia and the Carolinas. \n\nSince 2021 I've been doing these trips in a Tesla Model 3, which creates it's own challenges when taking rural routes, but it's doable!. For those that didn't know, a lot of evs have \"camp mode\". The climate control system works off the battery as you sleep in the back which is an awesome feature and life saver (got stuck for 5 hours once in Colorado due to an avalanche). As for range anxiety? Well I feel like I have it down now. I have 160k miles on my model 3 with no issues running out of juice yet (knock on wood). I've had one time I got to a station at -2% somehow, that was the closest I've been to getting stranded. \n\nIf Amtrak wasn't as expensive and slow/unreliable I would probably take it more just to relax. But for now I'll still be road tripping, hopefully this app or another similar app will make you guys go explore more too!",

Since I paid this car outright and it gave me no issues plus gave me so much fun around the mountain and coastal roads, I decided to restore her cosmetically.\n\nMechanical-wise, a multitude of warning lights were on because of an airbag issue, traction / ABS, CEL, and IMA light. I replaced some speed sensors, did a minor fix to the airbag module, and upgraded the 12V battery and the only thing I paid for in repairs was for the 12V battery.\n\nCosmetically the red paint was mismatched and clear coat was peeling. I got an insane deal on a repaint, hence why I was able to paint her Championship White (NH-0).\n\nI needed new tyres, so I decided to sell my old set of stock wheels and took some from an S2000 project I ultimately bailed on just as I did not have enough time. I got some Kumho Ecsta Sports on, and I can throw this around corners effortlessly. Also the ‘16 bumper facelift really looks good. I kept the ‘13-15 rear end as I can get an HPD diffuser later on. \n\nTop picture was taken May 2025 in Reno, NV (103,000 miles). Bottom picture was taken October 2025 in Columbus, OH (111,000 miles). I take care of this CR-Z religiously. I’ll either K-Swap + manual swap or just run this car until she can’t run anymore. \n\nAs a former VW GTI, Audi S7, Porsche Boxster, Porsche Macan, and current Tesla Model 3 driver, I never loved a car more than this. Shoutout to you all in the CR-Z community too, this is easily one of the most welcoming communities to be part of!\n\n[Total cost of this CR-Z w/ all fixes: ~$8500-9500]",

        "title": "BUYER BEWARE: Dodge Charger Daytona - Numerous Issues - Lack of Support.",
        "selftext": "Hello reddit,\n\nI'm writing this post to document my ownership experience with the Dodge Charger Daytona, and to warn others from purchasing anything electric from Stellantis. This is my own experience, and to those who have had a positive ownership with the Daytona I'm glad. In my opinion the car drives and performs phenomenally.. when it works. To add I live in the DMV area.\n\nSo here's a short summary of the issues I've been having:\n\n\\- Does not charge consistently at stations. I've used Electrify America, Blink, Chargepoint, and attempted to use Tesla chargers.\n\n\\- Seat issue, the recline has nearly squished my rear seat passengers multiple times. If you cannot get out of the back seat in mere seconds, I don't even recommend people getting back there.\n\n\\- Vehicle pushed through the brakes into an intersection. All safety lights came on (Collision control, traction control, red turtle for limp mode I assume) Then refused to turn back on for a few minutes. Almost like a big cammed car would push through brakes, lurched into traffic and left the front end of the car sitting on a busy roadway.\n\nTo explain further on each:\n\n**Charging issues**\n\nI have not been able to charge the vehicle consistently at any stations since purchase in 8/28. I would get nonstop errors, having to un-plug and re-plug in the vehicle every 5-10%, sometimes not even working at all. I've been left stranded with less than 5% left and when I returned to the dealership to get an emergency charge just to get home they called the police on me and trespassed me from their lot.. I've only been able to get it to work at a tesla charger once. I've used multiple different adapters from Amazon including the Dewalt and Lectron adapters. The only one that's worked so far is the charger in Easton, MD with the magic dock connector already installed. I had to tell the app I was a Cadillac Lyric to get it to work as well. I was supposed to get a free home charger with the purchase of the vehicle however I have still not been given that yet either. I travel a lot for work, and having inconsistent charging does not give me any confidence what-so-ever to use this on a day to day basis. I was stuck in West Chester, PA for over 2 hours having to un-plug and re-initiate the charging at a Chargepoint charger just to get enough to take it back to the dealership. It works when it wants to, which is less than 15% of the time.\n\n**Seat issue**\n\nI've had this issue since day one. At first I thought it was from having the seats back in the furthest most position, but after testing its not. One of my friends legs got caught when trying to get out causing him to fall. Another's entire body was pinched because they cant get out in under 5 seconds.. If you have children do NOT put them in the back if you are having this issue. There is no safety mechanism in place and you have to way for the seat to go back all the way and reset the setback to get it to move forward again. Quickest solution I've found to get someone out in this situation is to allow it to fully adjust back, and manually adjusting the seat forward. Which is insane to me that they have to sit in discomfort and potentially pain!\n\n**Vehicle pushing through brakes**\n\nThis was the last straw for me. I was willing to work with both Stellantis and the dealership on the other issues because I genuinely enjoyed the car. But when it put me at risk like that I cannot tolerate it. I do not feel safe operating the vehicle anymore. I was sitting at an exit from a store waiting to pull out into an intersection. Full foot on the brake, and I know for certain I wasn't accidentally hitting the accelerator because on the first \"jump\" I checked to make sure. It lurched through the brakes multiple times bucking like a cammed car would. Then threw all these warning lights, turtle icon came up saying speed limited, and the collision lights came on as well as traction control was disabled. Shut off and wouldn't power back on for a few minutes leaving the entire front half of my car sitting in oncoming traffic.\n\n**All this being said here are the responses I've received from the Dealer and Stellantis:**\n\nService writer is stating that the car is the most up to date car in the nation. The first time I checked it in they had it for 4 days, and updated a total of 9 modules. I took it to test and it worked for the first few days, then all the charging issues came back. The seats were never fixed. I spoke with the technician and he said I shouldn't have even bought the car.. The car is throwing over 40 fault codes, and keep coming back. Dealer stated that they are \"unofficial recalls\". It was explained to me that when they pull codes its supposed to give them a repair list of potential fixes and there are none. He stated that even Stellantis reps that are driving these cars as \"demos\" constantly bring them in for service for the same issues including the Wagoneer EV.\n\nStellantis has denied my buy back claim, the first time I checked it in for service the dealer does not have any loaner vehicles so I had to rent a vehicle and get reimbursed from Stellantis. They would only cover up to $60 a day for a rental where the cheapest I found was $80 for a sub compact... I still have yet to see that reimbursement check. The car has been sitting at the dealership now for over 3 weeks. I have been without a car. The only thing Stellantis is offering is rental reimbursement but I cant afford to frontload $1800 a month in rental fees + car payment. Its ridiculous for them to ask me to do this. When I call for updates the Stellantis rep said \"You don't have to call us as frequently for updates, we will call you when we have new information\"\n\nStellantis is stating they are expediting parts to fix the issues I'm having, however when I talk with the dealership they are stating that parts will not fix the issue and that it is entirely software related.\n\nWhen I attempted to get out of the car myself because I've explained multiple times that I drive over 30k miles a year and my job depends on me being able to travel the DMV/DE/PA area I was told by the dealership that I'm over 20k flipped in the car and that they recommended I communicate with service to get the issue resolved. I understand EV's tank in value day one but I also assumed buying a brand new car I wouldn't have something I can't depend on during the beginning of ownership.. When I stated this to the Sales Manager he flat out told me that I should've done my research first before purchasing the car, and said that's why he couldn't sell the one he has on his showroom floor.\n\nFor reference I will avoid dropping the names of the employees, however I will state that I bought the car from Heritage CDJR in Parkville, MD, and I've been doing all the service through my local dealer at Heritage CDJR in Owings Mills, MD. When I informed sales that there were no loaners available I asked to use a used car and they chuckled and said no. Understandable to an extent however I used to work for the Heritage organization and we did this more times than I could count for clients I had in the past. Parkville CDJR sales said I should continue bugging service instead of trying to trade out of the car and has since then stopped returning my calls. My buy back claim through Stellantis was denied. Stellantis offered reimbursement of some degree, wouldn't put any numerical value on it, and said they could only issue it after I pick up the vehicle from the dealer. So I am now paying for a vehicle that I cannot use. I've explained to them that I am a commission based employee and not being able to travel and sell is preventing me from creating any income currently. I also explained that my employer is upset and considering letting me go because I am unable to my job to the full extent. All I get back is \"sorry sir we are trying the best we can\"\n\nI'm at a loss with options, and I just want to warn anyone considering purchasing or leasing this vehicle. I unfortunately went the purchase route since I drive so many miles a year. I've been documenting this process with photos and text. I will update further when I receive more information. Thanks to those who took the time to read my post! Please share this if you could as the only recommendation I got from the Service team was to \"publish my experience to social media because Stellantis doesn't like it\"\n\nTLDR: Nonstop mechanical issues, charging issues, and safety issues. No offer of support from Dealership or Stellantis. Buyers Beware.",

        "title": "Scaling Cocoon of Finality because holy moly recent downplay is crazy",
        "selftext": "Hello, as the title says, I am going to clear up the misunderstanding regarding Cocoon of Finality, and why it's downplay to call it “Emanator-level.”\n\nFirst and before we start, I state that Cocoon scales to cosmology, particularly Imaginary Space, in fact any pure imaginary entity whose “true form” resides there scales to it, and CoF in IM-Space as “True Herrscher”, is one of them and equal to Aeons.\n\nIf interested about where cosmology scales, [I already made a scaling post about it (excluding Absolute Infinity as I believed most know)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerScaling/s/oz4S5SPdXy). But in short, the verse is at lowest interpretation 1-B (*cough cough* downplay *cough cough*), and reaches to L1-A via Absolute Infinity, which is also where I scale it. Which, by this, CoF is at least 1-B, so the Kiana.\n\nI will divide the post into three part:\nWhat is Cocoon of Finality\nMemokeeper’s Statement\nSea of Quanta and Project STIGMA exists\n\n\nSo, without further delay, let's go.\n\n—\n\nCocoon of Finality\n\nWell, let's start with an explanation of what CoF is.\n\n[The Cocoon of Finality is the true source of all phenomenas across the Honkai that transcends all dimensions,](https://imgur.com/a/cocoon-of-finality-FT6WII8)\n\nThe Cocoon of Finality, being the true origin of the Honkai, has full authority over the Honkai across all Imaginary Endings. Project Stigma harassed and made use of the Cocoon, in-order to confiscate its power of the Finality; Tesla referenced to PROMETHEUS hacking into the Cocoon of Finality, hence becoming the Will of Honkai as if it stole the powers of Finality like fire. (Hance, “Prometheus”, and also scales to Authority of Finality too)\n\nThe Cocoon of Finality governs all Herrscher Cores and Imaginary Singularities, it links every Honkai and Imaginary derived and related phenomena all together into a single meta-entity, hence every existing Herrscher Core and Imaginary Singularity all inherently correlates and derives from the existence of the Cocoon -- it explains why Tesla describes it as the only true Herrscher Core and Imaginary Singularity.\n\n[CoF should be the “source” of this variations](https://imgur.com/a/XGvH2dl)\n\n\n[In other words, we can say Herrschers, all of them, are merely “shadows” of Finality, much much finite to it.](https://imgur.com/a/BUmRH2s)\n\nThat should be enough, now, we go for the next topic…\n\nMemokeeper's Statement\n\nNow, we reach the statement that people make a fallacy out of. What is the whole thing? Well…\n\nThe reference to a Memokeeper describing Kiana Kaslana as \"Emanator level\" originates from the in-game story of Honkai Impact 3rd version 7.8 (released in September 2024), specifically in a dream sequence where an unnamed Memokeeper from the Garden of Recollection (a faction in Honkai: Star Rail) visits Kiana while she is in a coma-like sleep state. This is part of a crossover lore element connecting the two games, where the Memokeeper attempts to extract or trade memories from Kiana but is refused. The Memokeeper then remarks on Kiana's power and influence.\n\nThe Memokeeper's exact line (based on fan translations of the Chinese original, as the global English localization was adjusted for clarity) is approximately: \"Just with your will, you can stir waves like an Emanator.\" This is not stating that Kiana is an Emanator (a term from Honkai: Star Rail referring to mortals empowered by Aeons), but that her mere thoughts or willpower produce an impact comparable to one, even in a weakened state and in a world without Aeon influence. And the “waves” Kiana gives out, mind you, are in SLEEP-STATE, she's not even trying. And the devs confirm you need either 1 Aeon OR 3 Emanators level of power to reflect on the mirror of the garden of recollection, SHE DOES IT COMA-STATE.\n\n[Here is a Reddit post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/houkai3rd/s/afip25hHRb)\n\n[Here is a video of scene itself](https://youtu.be/X-aqr3lvxxA?si=XPL5FV1G_emZHZA4)\n\n[Another discussion of it](https://m.hoyolab.com/#/article/35197579)\n\nLiterally in any view you look at it, it doesn't make sense saying Kiana should be “Emanator-level.”\n\nSea of Quanta & Project Stigma\n\nAside from the fact that the Sea of Quanta exists and is basically destroying all arguments for “Emanator level Kiana” as it already is a 11D structure with IM-Tree being beyond it, we want to speak about something else…\n\nProject STIGMA, the most interpretive, wankable, I-hate-this-shit piece of the series.\n\nBut I have nothing to say about where it scales right now…\n\nTell me, how when there is something like Project Stigma—that surely the very concept of it is beyond the existence of some random Emanators chosen by Aeons—that exists so it *reach* or even surpass the level Finality, the Finality itself should be “not even galaxy level”?\n\nFinality is, by nature, originated from IM-Space and *exists* in there, like Aeons true form being there, it's the ultimate admin authority.\n\nBronya already surpassed Project STIGMA (we are not going to speak about her scale since she's the most NLF-worthy character with weirdest scaling among all), and Kiana “embraced” CoF, both are characters with qualities way above whatever Emanators shown (now people going to use DC as counterarguments…).\n\nI am not here speaking it's 1-B or L1-A (we are not here to scale cosmology now), I am here speaking about “Emanator-level” (whatever from planetary to galaxy or higher), which is an obvious downplay of the very character’s scale of power.\n\n“She's carried by statements”… duh? Well, *yes* who isn't being “carried by statements”? All of the characters are carried by statements. CoF a “entity”/force with 1-B/L1-A scaling by cosmology.\n\nIt's “featless”… well, not that Finality needs feats honestly, but nevertheless, Otto created a Proper World and Kiana also had the feat of resting a Proper World, they are feats.\n\n—\n\nThat is my argument for the invalidity of “merely Emanator level Kiana”, I wanted to make this post because I saw a lot of people suddenly turning into this direction that Kiana is Emanator level (obviously not going to even mention where or by who, it's against the roles anyway), so this post is the evidence of me being ragebaited, yeah I accept the fact that I indeed got ragebaited.\n\nEnd of post.",

body of 14 year old celeste rivas hernandez in the trunk of a tesla registered to singer d4vd\n* robbery homicide division took over the case\n* lapd searched a hollywood hills house with a 12 hour warrant and seized devices\n* his us tour was canceled and the deluxe album disappeared\n* advertisements came down and property records moved into his mother’s name\n* the medical examiner has not ruled the death a homicide the cause and manner remain undetermined\n\n**just below the surface signs that could point toward guilt**\n\n* tesla logs possibly showing the car never left his hands\n* gps and license plate reader data matching the days celeste was missing\n* dna hair or blood connecting him to her or the trunk\n* discord messages or search history about decomposition or concealment\n* property transfers timed suspiciously close to the discovery\n\n**just below the surface reasons doubt still exists**\n\n* other people might have had access to the tesla\n* gps could place the car somewhere he was not\n* no dna link may exist\n* discord screenshots online could be fake or irrelevant\n* decomposition timeline might not match his possession of the car\n* his statements might line up with independently verified data\n\n**the deeper layer why charges have not been filed**\n\n* the body being in his car is undeniable but without cause of death a clear access chain and direct forensic proof the case is fragile\n* if prosecutors move too early and the case cracks in court it cannot be retried\n\n**the deeper details most people overlook**\n\n* tesla telemetry records everything from doors and trunks opening to which phone key unlocked the car this data can create a minute by minute diary\n* license plate readers across los angeles track vehicle movement and could be overlaid with celeste’s last known locations\n* decomposition science matters heat speeds it up shade slows it down that could reveal whether she was in the car for days or weeks\n* seized devices phones laptops hard drives may contain discord logs messages or search history that either incriminate him or clear him\n\n**recent updates:**\n\n* the remains have been officially confirmed as celeste rivas hernandez\n* investigators stated she had been in the tesla for an extended period before discovery\n* the hollywood hills house tied to him was searched under a warrant electronics were seized\n* brands such as crocs and hollister pulled campaigns connected to him\n* the remaining us tour dates were canceled\n* his music streams have actually risen since the story broke\n\n**the bottom of the iceberg what matters most**\n\n* the case comes down to time the decomposition timeline versus the tesla timeline biology is not biased once the window is set the only question is who had control of the car during that time\n* silence from lapd suggests they already know more than they have released\n* silence from d4vd feels even heavier not once has he said celeste’s name or spoken about her family that might be legal strategy but it feels like a void\n* the truth is already stored in data and science the car logs the devices the biology it all exists it is just waiting for investigators to bring it forward\n\n***what keeps circling in my head is that this whole case is about time and silence. not rumors not symbolism not theories. time and silence.***\n\n***science does not bend. biology does not care about fame lawyers or what social media thinks. a decomposing body follows rules. heat speeds it up shade slows it down. when investigators lock in how long celeste was in that trunk that window becomes the hinge the entire case swings on. once that window is set the only question left is who had the tesla during those days or weeks.***\n\n***that is why the tesla telemetry feels so important. those cars are like diaries on wheels. every door that opened every trunk latch every route driven every seat sat in every key or phone that unlocked it. all of that is a timeline inside the timeline. it can show exactly who touched that car and when. once you overlay that data with decomposition science and license plate readers across los angeles you can build a map of truth that is hard to argue with.***\n\n***and then there is the silence. silence is not neutral here it has weight. the lapd has not told us what they found in the logs or on the seized devices. if they pulled that data they already know more than we do. their silence feels like a strategy to protect the investigation but it also leaves the public suspended in uncertainty. and then there is d4vd’s silence. he has not said celeste’s name once. he has not offered condolences or even acknowledged her family. maybe that is what lawyers told him to do but as a human it feels like absence. when your name is tied to a girl found in your trunk and you say nothing that void becomes its own kind of evidence in the court of public perception.***\n\n***what makes this harder is that the truth already exists. it is not a mystery waiting for inspiration it is a puzzle waiting for confirmation. the car logs exist. the devices seized in the hollywood hills raid exist. the biology of decomposition exists. license plate readers exist. surveillance footage exists. all of it is already written down in data code and science. the only thing missing is when investigators decide to release it.***\n\n***i also keep thinking about the details that don’t get talked about. celeste was fifteen. she had family she had a community that has already held vigils for her. while people argue online about guilt or innocence a family is trying to grieve. and the body has now been released for her funeral which brings the human part back into focus. it is easy to talk about data and evidence but this started with a child in a trunk. sometimes i feel like that truth gets lost under all the speculation.***\n\n***and so i come back to time and silence. time will be set by biology and science. silence will be broken when investigators bring forward what they already know. until then we are in the in-between. the truth is there in the logs and in the science. it just has not been spoken yet. and sometimes silence is the loudest part of the case.***\n\nthis writeup is based on what i researched and watched in media coverage and public reporting. it is not about picking sides or making one party look worse than the other. it is only a breakdown of what has been reported so far.\n\n**disclaimer:**  \ni just want to be upfront that i put this together using news reports and stuff that’s already out there in the media. nothing here is me trying to accuse anyone or make one side look worse than the other. some of the writing and organization was helped by ai but the research and sources i looked into are mine. i used ai more like a tool to keep it clear and readable, not to make things up. everything in this post comes from public info (like ap, ktla, variety, etc). i’m just really interested in the case and trying to piece things together in a way that makes sense. please read multiple sources and form your own opinion too.i also watched coverage on law and crime to follow the updates and make sure i was hearing things directly from court and news footage. please read multiple sources and form your own opinion too.\n\nupdate: i just went back and fully edited this post to make a couple important fixes. first the trigger warning is now at the very top so anyone reading knows right away that sensitive topics are being discussed. second i corrected celeste’s age throughout the post she was 14 when she was tragically taken from her life. what happened to her is devastating and heartbreaking and it’s so important to get the details right so her story is remembered accurately. i wanted to make sure it’s clear and accurate for anyone reading or referencing this post. thanks for being patient while i made these updates.",

        "title": "Tesla to Lightning Experience",
        "selftext": "Switched from a 2023 Model Y Performance to a 2025 Ford Lightning Flash – my honest thoughts so far.\n\nSo after owning a Model Y Performance for a 3 years I recently switched to a 2025 Ford Lightning Flash. Thought I’d share my one year impressions for anyone curious or on the fence.\n\n⸻\n\nThings I Like (a lot):\n\n1. Driving comfort & road noise:\nThe Lightning drives way better. It’s literally a night and day difference in comfort and how quiet it is on the road. The Model Y P always felt harsh, road noise was so much, rattling all over the place, but the Lightning just glides, so quite, build is wayyyyy better. ( this one is really huge)\n\n2. Space & practicality:\nThe cabin feels massive — tons more legroom, cup holders, and side storage. Even small things like the center console design make a big difference. And of course, the frunk is way bigger, and the bed is a massive plus.\n\n3. Range accuracy:\nThis surprised me — the Lightning’s predicted range has been spot-on for me so far. My Tesla was all over the place when it came to range estimates, especially in the cold.\n\n4. Snow driving:\nI live in Canada, so snow performance matters a lot. The Model Y P was terrible in snow, even with good tires. The Lightning, even on stock tires, feels rock solid. Huge difference. ( this is huge if you live up north)\n\n5. Real-world range:\nMaybe my Tesla had issues, but I’m actually getting better overall range from the Lightning ER. Even though the Tesla was technically more efficient, the Lightning seems to hold its range better in real-world (cold) conditions. Model Y Long Range might have equal or more but the performance one bas quite a bit less range than ER.\n\n⸻\n\nThings I Don’t Like (so far):\n\n1. Software & UI:\nFord’s software just doesn’t feel as smooth or polished. Starting the truck with a button feels weird now after Tesla’s seamless setup. Not a dealbreaker, but noticeable.\n\n2. Side-view cameras:\nI miss Tesla’s side camera feed that popped up when using turn signals. I can’t seem to get that same functionality here — maybe it’s hidden in settings, but it’s not obvious.\n\n3. Maps & charging network:\nTesla’s integration of chargers and route planning is miles ahead. \n\n4. Audio system:\nThe Model Y Performance had much better speakers. The Flash trim is decent, but it doesn’t hit the same.\n\n5. Fun / convenience features:\nTesla still wins in small details — like the automatic charge port door, memory seat profiles, games, Netflix/YouTube while parked, etc. Those little touches were nice to have.\n\n6. Ford app sucks compared to Tesla.\n⸻\n\nOverall Verdict:\n\nI honestly don’t regret the switch. I’d pick the Lightning again without hesitation.\nThe drive comfort, space, and winter capability easily outweigh the software and feature differences for me.\n\nIf you care more about driving experience and practicality — Lightning wins.\nIf you care more about tech and software polish — Tesla still has the edge.\n\nBut for me (in snowy Canada), the Lightning is the better everyday vehicle.\n\n\nFew questions I have if someone read this much. My build says tailgate lift assist but it just slams down no dampning and no assist when going up. What is this about ? \nAlso I am on fence to buy extended warranty. Is it beneficial ? I want to keep this for long term. \nI was quoted 2500CAD for 60months or 120k kms.\n\nThanks\n\n\nEdit : Main thing I hate with Ford is the dealership experience , that was sooooo painful. They tried to sell sooo much stuff. The negotiations , wiggle room etc etc.\nHate that experience even though its one and done.",

She's been homeless both because she is insufferable to live with but also because she refuses to give up her Land Rover that had an insane sticker price. MIL claims that the reason she hasn't got rid of it is because she has to have a \"premium\" car, but I'm pretty sure she is just underwater on the payments and may have refinanced it. MIL heard we were trading the Tesla and asked my wife if she would do a straight trade for the LR, which still has payments that we don't even know how many or how much.\n\nMy wife hasn't been completely talked into the trade yet, but she is leaning toward it and her mother is extremely manipulative. I don't want to be stuck with the LR, its payments or its blackhole of gas mileage. Should I just go ahead and trade the Tesla behind mind wife's back since she already picked out the minivan she wants to nip this in bud?",

        "selftext": "Even een update omdat de vorige post erg veel aandacht kreeg (meer dan 60.000 views).\n\n- Na onderhandeling met de leasemaatschappij door de garage is het onderhoud en de vervanging van de voorste draagarmen betaald, dus de verwachtte €2.600 aan verwachte kosten zijn van tafel gegaan.  \n- De  remmen bleken voorlopig in OK staat, dus die zijn niet vervangen.  \n- Jullie vragen omtrent *groot onderhoud* waren terecht: nadat de monteur het later een kleine beurt noemde, bleek het uiteindelijk te gaan om een 'smeerbeurt' (\"Bij een Tesla is er geen groot of klein onderhoud.”)\n\nVervolgens heb ik de knoop doorgehakt: auto gekocht voor €16.650.\n\nDit is inclusief zomer- en winterbanden bij de auto. Ook nog het aanbod van een half uurtje polijsten gehad, maar dat staat niet in het contract, dus dat moeten we nog afwachten (want dat was in gesprek nog voor het \"gedoe\" omtrent reparatie).\n\nAnyway, met de accu op 93% SoH, het feit dat ik de auto ken plus dat ik nu niet opnieuw op zoek hoef, ben ik blij de uitkomst. \n\nBedankt aan iedereen die in de vorige thread advies gaf (positief of negatief). Was super nuttig om het af te wegen! \n\nBy the way, jullie reacties waren als volgt :):   \n  \n| Categorie | Sentiment bij €19.250 | Sentiment bij €16.650 | Verandering |\n|------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|\n| 🟢 **Positief (kopen / doen)** | 23% | **42%** | ▲ +19 p.p. |\n| ⚪ **Neutraal / voorwaardelijk** | 29% | **36%** | ▲ +7 p.p. |\n| 🔴 **Negatief (niet doen / te duur)** | 48% | **22%** | ▼ −26 p.p. |\n\nTL;DR:  \nOvergenomen voor €16.650, onderhoud betaald door leasemaatschappij, remmen prima, set banden erbij.

        "selftext": "Not to get Sci Fi terminator on you all, but when I see headlines of China and the United States producing robots en masse, Tesla aiming to produce 1/5th of China's army worth of robots, I don't see how they will be able to resist using them for military applications.\n\nAfter all, they're the perfect peace-keeping/invading forces. Much more impervious to bullets than humans, the technology is getting slowly better and soon they could be more cost efficient, and have better physical endurance and prowess than humans (Try to find the nearest human that can do a backflip like Unitree G1 does), better strategic coordination and awareness of other units, etc.. \n\nAnd unlike nuclear bombs, no mass destruction, and a much of specific target killing capability. A robot army couldn't even have to wipe out cities to take over a country, they would just have to storm the government's whereabouts and take captive or kill head of states. \n\nThere is zero risk of a robot dying since they are nigh infinitely replaceable. If a unit gets destroyed, they can just instantly produce and ship in another robot and still completely swarm any opposing army with sheer numbers. \n\nNo need to draft, or worry about training your army, or losing too much soldiers.\n\nI think nation states will probably make great use of it to subjgate other countries for heir resources. Suddenly, the great economic powers will have inexhaustible numbers of extremely capable robotic supersoldiers, and other countries will either have the possibility of fighting to their death, or capitulation and being subjgated by the invading army.\n\nSuddenly, there will be much more resources wars, and alot of the major superpowers' rivals to their geopolitical influence could be taken out.\n\nThe only way for nations to be able to survive will be nuclear armament, like UK, France, North Korea, Pakistan etc... or their own robot army, like China or the United States.\n\nSure, the technology might not be here yet, but nuclear bombs were only theorized for the first half of the 20th century, until they became a very real treat to all of human existence for the latter of it.\n\nCompared to where we were in the beginning of the 21st century, which was basically no general embodied intelligence robotics at all, to fledgling general embodied intelligence robotics, i think it's safe to say that this could very well become the new dominating scenario of post-2045 warfare.

It was really pronounced today after dark in the rain.\n\n~ Red arrows take 2-3 minutes to turn. 🤷🏻 \n\n~ It’s not uncommon for cars to “park” in driving lanes with their flashers on, especially on quiet side streets with no spots open. There was a Tesla parked like this OVERNIGHT last week on my block…in the driving lane. \n\nThat’s all I can think of right now. On a positive note, I feel very safe here! I’ve had a lot of people ask me what I think of “the crime” and “the heat” moving from MN. Uhm, really good! I’m happy to not be calling in gunfire once a week (twin cities), dealing with 100° degree heat with a dew point of 80, and getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. 🤣\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \n\nI’m reaching out to fellow Model 3 owners and Tesla enthusiasts for perspective and advice.\nLast week, my 2020 Model 3 (manufactured November 2019) had its rear bumper completely detach after driving through moderate rainfall and standing water on a Florida roadway. There was no collision or unsafe driving; a passing driver alerted me that the bumper had come off.\nHere’s what’s happened so far:\n•\tThe car was towed to a Tesla‑certified collision center (European Body Shop) the same evening.\n•\tProgressive Insurance initially denied coverage, assuming I was “at fault” for driving through water—then reversed their decision after verifying this matched Tesla’s previously documented design flaw (SB‑20‑12‑003).\n•\tTesla West Palm Beach Service Manager  reviewed the case but denied goodwill assistance, stating the bulletin applies only to vehicles built before May 2019.\n•\tMy vehicle’s production date, November 24 2019, is just six months later and the failure is identical in cause and appearance.\n\nWhat’s most concerning is that Tesla has already admitted this issue.  \n\nThe AutoEvolution investigation linked here  (https://www.autoevolution.com/news/document-proves-tesla-admits-model-3-rear-bumper-design-flaw-though-quietly-150396.html ) includes Tesla’s internal documentation confirming:\n\n“In rare instances… Model 3 vehicles built at Fremont before May 21 2019 might be damaged when driving through standing water… the rear fascia might detach.”\n\nThis appears to be the same defect, occurring just outside Tesla’s stated cutoff date—suggesting that the production “fix” didn’t fully solve the underlying problem.\n\nTo be clear:\n\n•\tProgressive confirmed the incident was not driver fault.\n\n•\tThe detachment poses safety and cost concerns for all Model 3 owners driving in wet conditions.\n\n•\tTesla acknowledges the design flaw but is denying assistance on a technicality.\n\nMy escalation request is now going to corporate executive relations, with documentation showing:\n\n1.\tTesla’s internal admission (SB‑20‑12‑003, July 2020)\n\n2.\tProduction record confirming proximity to affected VIN range\n\n3.\tProgressive Insurance reversal proving the defect caused the loss\n\n4.\tPhotos of the damage and service correspondence\n\nIf anyone here has experienced similar bumper or under‑body detachment—from mid‑ to  late‑2019 and early- 2020 Model 3 builds—please comment or message me. \n\nI believe this is a continuing design issue, not an isolated case.\n\nTesla has an opportunity here to uphold its reputation for innovation by standing behind its customers. A simple goodwill repair or extended support acknowledgment would go a long way toward restoring owner confidence.\n\nOpen to your experiences, recommendations, and any contacts who successfully escalated similar issues through Tesla corporate.\n\nThank you all.  \n\n\nVIN ending …0422",

Imagine launching projects without worrying about slow TPS or congested networks. With Rollups, dev tools, grants, and a strong community, it gives builders everything they need to turn ideas into reality faster and smarter.\n\nHere’s a wild stat: Polkadot’s Nakamoto Coefficient is 157, that’s 50x more decentralized than Bitcoin and leagues ahead of Ethereum or Solana’s centralized vibes.\n\nAnd there’s more on the horizon: Polkadot 2.0, JAM upgrades, Hong Kong expansion, a 2.1B DOT supply cap, potential ETFs, and no-code rollups.\n\nDevelopers, listen up: Polkadot ranks #2 in active devs, with 675K commits in 2025 alone. And if you love Ethereum tools, Solidity, Hardhat, MetaMask, they work seamlessly on Polkadot. No code rewrites, just fast, low-cost builds for DeFi, gaming, and beyond.\n\nThis is the kind of ecosystem where visionary builders like Gav can create something that actually changes the game, one block at a time.\n\nStay GIGA Bullish and #BelieveInGav\n",

Let’s keep it positive — every bit of resistance counts!\n\nFeel free to share the poster on other forums and platforms.\n\nMy RISE score this past week is **4**.  \n**What’s your RISE score?**",
